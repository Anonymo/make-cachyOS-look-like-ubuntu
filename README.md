Script for Installation of a Debian Gnome Desktop System, I like. Make the System Appeareance more "ubuntuuish". 

After the first run of setup.sh, you have to reboot and re-run the script.

```bash
$ bash setup.sh
```

You can customize standard packages, which got installed. Just edit the Array in `include/packages.inc.sh`
